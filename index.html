		Welcome to RetroReboot.net!
		<br/><br/>
		This site is dedicated to my projects involving retro games and hardware.</br>
		</br>
		When I tackled my first hardware project, I was just a hobbyist without a clue,
		with no idea where to start. Over time, I realized that most of the information
		I needed was online, but finding it was the hard part. I want to keep all of 
		that random research in one central place to help others who might want to
		try the same, or similar, projects.</br>
		</br>
		I also wanted to walk through the process of completing the project from start
		to finish. This might help explain why I did certain things, how I learned from
		mistakes, and how I might do things differently in the future.</br>
		</br>
		Also, as with other projects, I'm learning HTML as I build this site, so 
		maybe it will be looking good in the coming weeks!</br>
		</br>
		Good luck, and happy modding!
