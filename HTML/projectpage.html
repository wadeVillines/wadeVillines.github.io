		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>
		This is a custom flash cartridge that was designed from scratch, that supports RTC just like 
		a retail RTC game. The best part is the 32KB of FRAM, so your save file will not be lost
		when the battery dies.
		</p>
		<h2>What's a Flash Cartridge?</h2>
		<p>
		A flash cartridge is just a normal cartridge that can be re-programmed.
		When you buy a retail cartridge, it will always contain the same game
		that it had when you bought it, and cannot be changed. A flash cartridge
		can be changed to any other game you want, as long as you have enough
		memory to hold it. Tired of playing Mega Man? Just overwrite it with
		Pokemon Silver!
		</p>
		<h2>What is RTC?</h2>
		<p>
		RTC stands for 'Real-Time Clock'. Not many games use a real-time clock,
		but the games that do use it have several time-based features that are 
		inaccessible without it.
		</p>
		<h2>What is FRAM?</h2>
		<p>
		In a normal Gameboy cartridge, there is a type of RAM called SRAM, or
		Static RAM. This RAM is just extra memory storage that can be used for
		many things. If your game has a save feature, your save file will be
		stored in RAM. The problem is, SRAM needs a constant power supply to retain
		the data stored within. You may have noticed that cartridges containing 
		SRAM also contain a coin battery to power the SRAM. Have you ever started
		up a game and noticed your save file was gone, or maybe you tried to save
		your game, and it was gone the next time you tried to play? This is likely 
		caused by a dead battery in your cartridge.</br>
		</br>
		FRAM, on the other hand, does not require a constant power supply. If FRAM
		is used instead, the battery can be removed and the save file will remain
		intact. However, the RTC still requires the battery to keep track of time.
		When the battery dies, one can just replace the battery and reset the clock
		without having to worry about losing game progress. This is especially useful
		in games such as Pokemon, where players tend to invest many valuable hours.
